# OnTheRoad

This is a low arcade race game made for the mini ludum dare 74 with Kwarthys.

It was worked on a bit after the ludum dare but is not being currently worked on.

## Random mode

In Random mode a track is generated according to the style selected and a seed.

The map generation can still generate some undoable tracks, in that case just enter a new seed on the bottom right input.

## Drift Mode

In drift mode you have 2 minutes to the best score you can. Drifting is the only way to increase your score ;)
